<p>A&nbsp;<strong>book</strong>&nbsp;is a medium for recording&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a>&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing">writing</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image">images</a>, typically composed of many&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(paper)">pages</a>&nbsp;(made of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus">papyrus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment">parchment</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum">vellum</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">paper</a>)&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookbinding">bound</a>&nbsp;together and protected by a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cover">cover</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;The technical term for this physical arrangement is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex">codex</a></em>&nbsp;(plural,&nbsp;<em>codices</em>). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll">scroll</a>. A single sheet in a codex is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recto">leaf</a>&nbsp;and each side of a leaf is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(paper)">page</a>.</p>



<p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&#8216;s&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_(Aristotle)">Physics</a></em>&nbsp;is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.</p>



<p>The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book">e-books</a>&nbsp;and other formats.</p>



<p>Although in ordinary academic parlance a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph">monograph</a>&nbsp;is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_and_information_science">library and information science</a>&nbsp;<em>monograph</em>&nbsp;denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(bibliography)">volume</a>&nbsp;(book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust&#8217;s seven-volume&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time">In Search of Lost Time</a></em>), in contrast to serial publications like a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine">magazine</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal">journal</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper">newspaper</a>. An avid reader or collector of books is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliophilia">bibliophile</a>&nbsp;or colloquially, &#8220;bookworm&#8221;. A place where&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookselling">books are traded</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookshop">bookshop</a>&nbsp;or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_library">libraries</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a>&nbsp;has estimated that in 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of e-books.</p>

<p>Even the most methodical scientists and jaded skeptics can&#8217;t help but be impressed by the awesomeness of nature. Whether it&#8217;s the majesty of the Grand Canyon, the intensity of a hurricane, or the intricate beauty of a colorful butterfly, the world around us really is incredible. But the craziest thing about nature is perhaps that there is always new information to learn and new sights to see. So, we&#8217;ve rounded up some shocking, funny, and just plain weird <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.fun-facts.org.uk/wonders_of_world/natural_wonders.htm" target="_blank">facts about nature&#8217;s wonders</a> that will give you even <em>more</em> appreciation for the planet&#8217;s riches.<br></p>



<p>Arcadia trees, which grow all over the African savannah, have a unique defense system. When animals like antelopes start to gobble up its leaves, the tree&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717361-200-antelope-activate-the-acacias-alarm-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases tannin production</a>&nbsp;to levels that are toxic to animals.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all. The tree then emits a cloud of ethylene gas that travels through the air, reaching other trees so they too can begin producing more tannins.<br>On Earth, you need heat to fuse metal, but in space, two pieces of the same kind of metal will fuse together with only a little pressure. The process is called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://curiosity.com/topics/the-problem-of-cold-welding-in-space-curiosity/" target="_blank">cold welding</a>, and it happens because of the lack of atmosphere.</p>

<p>Although Brooklyn and Manhattan were once pegged against each other, Brooklyn has slowly edged the island out and fully grabbed hold of the &#8220;cool&#8221; title. Extremely hip and fashionable, the streets of Williamsburg have an impressive array of street murals and art. Hipsters congregate here, whether they are composing a song in a trendy cafe or scouring flea markets and food bazaars. For vintage clothing or local independent stores, even Manhattanites have to admit that it is worth making it over to Brooklyn. Ignore the chains and try something different, like Desert Island, a must for any comic book nerd.</p>



<p><strong>Recommended for&nbsp;<em>Best Shopping</em>&nbsp;because</strong>: It&#8217;s the new East Village and the streets are dotted with fun shops, cute cafes and low-key dive bars.</p>



<p><strong>Courtney&#8217;s expert tip</strong>: On summer Saturdays, Smorgasburg takes over a parking lot near the water. It&#8217;s the perfect place to try some new noms.<br></p>



<p>With a name like the Meatpacking District, it is somewhat surprising that this New York neighborhood is now a glamorous location. Once the headquarters of the meat industry, this area has been transformed completely (but former meat lockers and meat packers still remain). At the corner of Ninth Avenue and 14th Street, you&#8217;ll see the high tech Apple Store, mobbed day and night. The cobblestone streets are home to all the latest designer boutiques, Jeffrey, Stella McCartney, Catherine Malandrino. In addition, you will also find the hippest hotels and fantastic restaurants. Whether you are a fashionista or a foodie, the Meatpacking District has you covered.</p>



<p><strong>Recommended for&nbsp;<em>Best Shopping</em>&nbsp;because</strong>: It&#8217;s a place to see and be seen. Models mob the streets and cool crowds are everywhere.</p>



<p><strong>Courtney&#8217;s expert tip</strong>: To take in views of the city, grab a drink at Le Bain located at the top of the Standard Hotel.</p>
